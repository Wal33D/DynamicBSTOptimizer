# üå≥ Optimal Binary Search Tree Algorithms

Welcome to **OptimalBinarySearchTree-C**, a cutting-edge software module designed to unravel the complexities of constructing an optimal binary search tree (BST) using the dynamic programming approach. Aimed at students, educators, and algorithm enthusiasts, this project illuminates the path to understanding efficient binary search trees, rooted in the principles of dynamic programming and algorithm optimization.

## üåü Features

- **Dynamic Programming Mastery**: Delve into dynamic programming to construct the most efficient binary search tree.
- **In-Depth Efficiency Analysis**: Tools to measure and compare the constructed tree's efficiency against traditional methods.
- **Interactive Learning**: Engage with pre-defined examples to witness the impact of key distributions on tree efficiency.
- **Tailored Experience**: Input your own keys and probabilities to explore variations in optimal tree structures.
- **Visual Insights**: A visualization tool brings the abstract concept of BSTs to life, enhancing comprehension.
- **Analytical Depth**: Gain insights into performance metrics and cost analysis, emphasizing the benefits of optimization.

## üõ† Prerequisites

Gear up for your journey into algorithmic efficiency with:
- A GCC compiler or any C-compatible compiler
- Make (optional but recommended for ease of compilation)

## üîß Installation

Embark on your adventure with OptimalBinarySearchTree-C by following these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OptimalBinarySearchTree-C.git
   \`\`\`

2. **Navigate to your project directory**:
   \`\`\`bash
   cd OptimalBinarySearchTree-C
   \`\`\`

3. **Compile with GCC**:
   \`\`\`bash
   gcc -o OptimalBST main.c -lm
   \`\`\`
   Or, if you're using Make:
   \`\`\`bash
   make
   \`\`\`

## üöÄ Usage

Launch OptimalBST to start constructing and analyzing your optimal binary search tree:

\`\`\`bash
./OptimalBST
\`\`\`

Follow the prompts to input keys and their search probabilities. The tool then unveils the structure and efficiency metrics of your custom optimal BST.

### üìù Elementary Example

\`\`\`plaintext
Enter the number of elements: 4

Enter the A of 1: if
Enter the A of 2: for
Enter the A of 3: while
Enter the A of 4: count

Enter the P (Element) of 1: 4
Enter the P (Element) of 2: 3
Enter the P (Element) of 3: 2
Enter the P (Element) of 4: 1

Enter the Q (Probability) of 0: 1
Enter the Q (Probability) of 1: 2
Enter the Q (Probability) of 2: 3
Enter the Q (Probability) of 3: 4
Enter the Q (Probability) of 4: 5

Output:
Minimum cost = 55.000000
Root  = 3
