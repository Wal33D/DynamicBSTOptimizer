# OptimalBinarySearchTree-C

OptimalBinarySearchTree-C is a specialized software module designed to demonstrate how to construct an optimal binary search tree (BST) using dynamic programminimumCostg. This project aims to serve as an educational tool for students, educators, and professionals interested in understanding the principles behind building efficient binary search trees given a set of keys and their search probabilities.

## Features

- **Dynamic ProgramminimumCostg Approach**: Implements a dynamic programminimumCostg strategy to ensure the construction of the most cost-effective binary search tree.
- **Efficiency Analysis**: Provides tools for comparing the efficiency of the constructed tree with naive or brute-force approaches.
- **Interactive Examples**: Includes a set of pre-defined examples that highlight how different key distributions affect the structure and efficiency of the final tree.
- **Customizability**: Users can input their own sets of keys and probabilities to see how the optimal tree structure changes.
- **Visualization Tool**: Comes with a visualization component that helps users to graphically understand the tree structure.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates and displays the cost analysis of constructing the tree, enabling users to understand the implications of optimality.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- GCC compiler or any other C compiler compatible with your operating system
- Make (optional, for convenience)

## Installation

To install and compile OptimalBinarySearchTree-C, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OptimalBinarySearchTree-C.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd OptimalBinarySearchTree-C
```

3. To compile the project, you can use the GCC compiler directly:
```bash
gcc -o OptimalBST main.c -lm
```
   Or if you prefer using Make and have a `Makefile` in the project:
```bash
make
```

## Usage

After compiling the project, you can run it to construct an optimal binary search tree and perform analysis.

Basic usage:
```bash
./OptimalBST
```

The program will prompt you to enter the number of keys, followed by each key and its corresponding search probability. After providing the input, the tool will process the information and output the structure of the optimal binary search tree, along with efficiency metrics.
