# 🌳 Dynamic (Optimal) Binary Search Tree Algorithms

Welcome to **DynamicBSTOptimizer-C**, a software module designed for understanding and constructing optimal binary search trees (BSTs) using dynamic programming. This project is intended for students, educators, and enthusiasts interested in algorithm optimization and efficiency.

## 🌟 Features

- **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Implements dynamic programming to construct efficient binary search trees.
- **Efficiency Analysis**: Compare the efficiency of the constructed tree with traditional binary search tree methods.
- **Interactive Examples**: Use pre-defined examples to see how different key distributions affect tree efficiency.
- **Custom Inputs**: Allows entering custom keys and probabilities to explore various optimal tree structures.
- **Visualization Tool**: Includes a visualization tool to better understand the structure of BSTs.
- **Performance Metrics**: Offers insights into the constructed tree's performance and cost analysis.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- A GCC compiler or any compatible C compiler
- Make (optional, recommended for easier compilation)

## 🔧 Installation

To set up DynamicBSTOptimizer-C, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DynamicBSTOptimizer-C.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd DynamicBSTOptimizer-C
   ```

3. **Compile with GCC**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

To use OptimalBST and begin constructing and analyzing optimal binary search trees, run:

```bash
./build/obst
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to input keys and their search probabilities, and the tool will display the structure and efficiency metrics of your optimal BST.

### 📝 Elementary Example

```plaintext
Enter the number of elements: 4

Enter the A of 1: if
Enter the A of 2: for
Enter the A of 3: while
Enter the A of 4: count

Enter the P (Element) of 1: 4
Enter the P (Element) of 2: 3
Enter the P (Element) of 3: 2
Enter the P (Element) of 4: 1

Enter the Q (Probability) of 0: 1
Enter the Q (Probability) of 1: 2
Enter the Q (Probability) of 2: 3
Enter the Q (Probability) of 3: 4
Enter the Q (Probability) of 4: 5

Output:
Minimum cost = 55.000000
Root  = 3
```
